You are given a number and asked to format it as per Indian currency style, where:

The last 3 digits are grouped together.

Before that, digits are grouped in pairs of 2.

Any decimal part is kept intact.

Example
Input: 123456.7891
Indian format: 1,23,456.7891
(Not like 123,456.7891 which is the Western format)

How the Code Works
parts = str(number).split('.')
Splits into integer and decimal parts.


int_part = parts[0]
decimal = '.' + parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''
Handles the decimal (if present).


last_three = int_part[-3:]
rest = int_part[:-3]
Keeps last 3 digits separate.

Remaining digits are grouped in 2s using a loop.


formatted = ','.join(result) + ',' + last_three
Adds commas properly as per Indian style.


return formatted + decimal
Returns final formatted number.
Output

1,23,456.7891
